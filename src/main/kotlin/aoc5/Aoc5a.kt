 *
 * To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of
 * carefully-planned steps.
 *
 * They do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input)
 *
 * After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?
